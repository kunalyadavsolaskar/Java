Key points about abstract classes:

Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated; they can only be subclassed.
Abstract methods are declared without an implementation and must be overridden in the concrete subclasses.
Abstract classes can have constructor definitions that are invoked when a concrete subclass object is created.
Abstract classes can have instance variables and non-final methods.
Subclasses can extend only one abstract class.
